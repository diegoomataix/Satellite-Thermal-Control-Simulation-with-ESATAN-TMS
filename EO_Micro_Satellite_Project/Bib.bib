@techreport{Mehta2014,
abstract = {with the advancement in cryogenics, applications like optical sensors, electronic circuitry are devised to operate at very low temperature and thereby efficient heat transfer devices are required to transfer heat through a very low temperature gradient. In such cases even high conducting materials, like copper fail to transfer heat at the required levels as the temperature gradient is not sufficient. Cryogenic heat pipes stand out as a prominent heat transfer device in such low temperature gradient heat transfer without any external power. Heat pipe consists of basic three components, like container, working fluid and wick structure. The various working fluids which can be used in cryogenic heat pipe are nitrogen, oxygen, argon, helium, neon and propylene. Many types of heat pipes are available and the operation of a particular heat pipe for an application is constrained by a number of parameters. The paper deals with the review of various parameters like heat load, use of various working fluids, use of various wick structures, tilt angle and its effect on the performance of heat pipe at cryogenic temperature range.},

@article{Han2014,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014. The Astronomical Society of the Pacific. All rights reserved. A compact infrared space telescope called MIRIS (Multi-purpose Infra-Red Imaging System) was developed by the Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute (KASI), and launched onboard the Science and Technology Satellite-3 of Korea (STSAT-3) in 2013 November. The main mission of MIRIS is the Paschen-$\alpha$ emission line survey along the Galactic plane and the cosmic infrared background (CIB) observation, particularly around the north ecliptic pole region. For these missions, a wide field of view (3:67 × 3:67°) with an angular resolution of 51.6″ and wavelength coverage from 0:9 ∼ 2:0 $\mu$m have been adopted for MIRIS, having optical components consisting of a 80 mm main lens and four other lenses with F/2 focal ratio optics. The opto-mechanical system was carefully designed to minimize any effects from shock during the launch process and thermal variation. Also, the telescope was designed to use a passive cooling technique to maintain the temperature around 200 K in order to reduce thermal noise. A micro Stirling cooler was used to cool down the Teledyne PICNIC infrared array to 90 K, which was equipped in a dewar with four filters for infrared passbands of I, H, and Paschen-$\alpha$ and a dual-band continuum line filter. MIRIS system was integrated into the STSAT-3 as its primary payload and successfully passed required tests in the laboratory, such as thermal-vacuum, vibration, and shock tests. MIRIS is now operating in sun synchronous orbits for initial tests and has observed its first images successfully.},
